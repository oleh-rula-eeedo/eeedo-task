1.
Import persons.json in App.tsx.
Print out the list with console.log.

2.
Create typescript interface for a person.

3.
Let's render persons.
Using html's ordered list, print first name. 
Use the interface you created.

4.
Let's drop the whole ordered list
Change ordered list to a wrapper div and use div for each person too.

For styles, add at least:
- 1px black border for both wrapper and each person
- 10px padding for each person

5.
Now print person's title as combination of first_name and last_name separated with space.
Use appropriate heading tag.

6.
Print person's city under heading as span element.

7.
Show person's job if it includes: 'engineer'. Otherwise do not show.

8.
For each person, there should be a button that hides the person.

9.
Create a reset button which shows all the users again.

10.
Filter list based on first_name + last_name while user types in input field.

Bonus points:

11. 
Debounce filtering by 250ms.
Filtering should only work when you stop typing for 250ms

12.
Animate hiding the user.
It should fade away in 2000ms.
