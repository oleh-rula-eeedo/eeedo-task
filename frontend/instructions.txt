1. Import persons.json in App.tsx
2. Create typescript interface for person in that array
3. Render persons, print first name using ordered list in html. Use the interface you created.
4. Change ordered list to be a div element. Add a 1px wide black border to the div and padding of 10px.
5. Now print person's title with appropriate heading as combination of first_name and last_name separated with space.
6. Print city as plain text under heading as paragraph.
7. Show person's job if it includes word: 'engineer'.
8. Create a button inside person's div that hides that user
9. Create a button above the list which resets hidden users
10. Filter list based on first_name + last_name while user types in input field

Bonus:

11. Add lodash, debounce filtering by 250ms so filtering only works when you stop typing for 250ms
12. Animate hiding the user so it fades away over 2 seconds.
